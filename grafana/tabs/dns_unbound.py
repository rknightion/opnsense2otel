DNS - Unbound tab for the opnsense2otel dashboard.

Covers all opnsense_unbound_dns_* metrics across seven rows:
  1. Service         — uptime, service running, blocklist, queries qps, cache hit ratio
  2. Cache & Recursion — prefetch/expired/recursive/recursion times/request list
  3. DNSSEC & Anomalies — secure/bogus/rrset_bogus/unwanted/timed_out/ratelimited
  4. Query Breakdowns   — by type / protocol / rcode / flags / edns
  5. Cache & Memory     — cache_count, memory_bytes, tcp_usage_ratio
  6. Upstream Infra Cache (opt-in) — infra_rtt/rto
  7. DNSBL / Query Stats (opt-in)  — qstats totals, blocklist size, local zones/data/insecure domains
  8. Per-Query Log (opt-in, Loki)  — the `unbound` POLL lane's per-query records
  9. Per-Query Log - syslog route (opt-in, Loki) — the same queries via Unbound's own
     log-queries/log-replies output (#659)

Row 8 reads a LOG STREAM, not metrics (#591 item 5). The `unbound` source
(`--logs.unbound.enabled`, internal/logship/unbound.go) ships one record per DNS
query carrying dns_client_label / domain / qtype / action / query_source / rcode /
blocklist / dnssec_status — and until #591 nothing on the dashboard read any of it, so
"which client is being blocked by which list" was unanswerable from the estate even
though the data was already in Loki.

Row 9 reads the OTHER per-query route (#659): Unbound's own log-queries/log-replies
output, which arrives over syslog rather than by polling. The two rows are separate on
purpose and only one should ever be populated — the routes are mutually exclusive at
startup, because both log the same queries and running both bills Loki twice.

They cannot share panels. The poll lane's structured metadata uses bare keys
(`domain`, `qtype`, `rcode`) while the syslog lane uses the dotted vocabulary the other
syslog parsers use (`dns.query_name` -> `dns_query_name`, and so on), so a single
selector reading both would match the stream and render blank columns — which looks
like data loss rather than a disabled lane. Each route gets its own row behind its own
sentinel instead.

Note the syslog route lands under `opnsense_source="syslog"`, NOT `"unbound"`:
`opnsense_source` names the RECEIVER, and `opnsense_subsystem="dns"` is a coarse
routing aid shared with dnsmasq (registry.py's map is "a routing aid, not a
taxonomy"). `program` is wire-derived and deliberately unpromotable, so it cannot be a
stream label — hence the `| program="unbound"` filter after the selector.

**Select on `opnsense_source`, never on `opnsense_subsystem`.** The lane builds its
attributes without `logship.AttrSubsystem` (verified in internal/logship/unbound.go),
so its records carry no subsystem label at all: a selector naming it there matches
nothing and reports no error. `tests/test_loki_scoping.py` pins both ends of that.

The row 7 qstats leaderboards and row 8's tables look similar and answer different
questions. qstats is Unbound's OWN rolling ~7-day aggregate, cheap, truncated at 512
domains, and available with no log shipping. The Loki tables are per-query records
over the dashboard's window, complete, and carry the CLIENT — which is the field
qstats has no equivalent for and the reason this row exists.
