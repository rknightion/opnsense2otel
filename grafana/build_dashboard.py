Build the opnsense2otel Grafana v2 dynamic dashboard.

Usage:
    python3 build_dashboard.py            # write dashboard.json + run coverage gate
    python3 build_dashboard.py --check    # coverage gate only (non-zero exit if gaps)

The dashboard is a single `dashboard.grafana.app/v2` manifest using TabsLayout with
per-tab/row conditionalRendering driven by hidden sentinel variables, so tabs and rows
auto-hide when their metrics are absent. See grafana/README.md.

# the catalogue and is deliberately kept. Each entry needs a written reason, exactly
# as COVERAGE_EXEMPT's do — a bare name here silently re-opens the hole the gate
# exists to close.
#
# EMPTY BY DESIGN. Every legitimate shape the estate actually uses is handled
# structurally by `panel_metric_gaps()` (histogram child series, recording-rule
# output names, the `opnsense_instance` label token), so an entry here means a panel
# is querying something no build of this exporter can emit. If you are about to add
# one, first check it is not simply a typo — that is what item 1 of #591 turned out
# to be, and it survived from the first dashboard commit.

# ---- the runtime-metric ledger (#591 item 4) ----------------------------
# `coverage()` cannot see any of these. `load_catalogue()`'s row regex admits only
# `opnsense_`-prefixed names, and it could not do otherwise: the catalogue documents
# what THIS codebase emits, while `up`, `go_*` and `process_*` come from the
# Prometheus server and the client library. So the whole runtime namespace is
# structurally invisible to the gate that reports "1020/1020 metrics referenced" —
# blind spot 1 of #591.
#
# The answer is a written decision rather than a widened regex. Rob's call
# (2026-07-31) was selective coverage plus this ledger: panel the runtime metrics
# that answer a question nothing else answers, and record a REASON for each family
# left off, so "we decided not to chart that" stops being tribal knowledge that the
# next audit has to re-derive from scratch.
#
# Keys are exact metric names, or a `*` suffix for a family. Longest matching key
# wins, so a specific name overrides the family it sits in. Values are
# (verdict, reason); verdict is PANELLED or EXCLUDED.
#
# WHAT THE GATE ENFORCES, and what it cannot: `runtime_ledger_gaps()` checks both
# directions of the PANELLED half — a panel querying a runtime metric with no
# PANELLED entry fails, and a PANELLED entry no panel queries fails. The EXCLUDED
# half is a decision record and is NOT enforceable here, because nothing in this
# repo can enumerate what the client library will emit on the operator's platform
# and version without scraping a live process. Treat a missing EXCLUDED entry as a
# documentation gap, not as a passing check.

# There is deliberately no "Observability" domain (#523). It held three leaves that
# were grouped by HOW their numbers were produced — derived from syslog, rolled up
# from flow records, precomputed by a recording rule — which is an implementation
# detail rather than a question anyone opens a dashboard to ask. Splitting them by
# WHO reads them put every firewall-operational panel on the domain tab that already
# owns its subsystem (filterlog events beside the pf counters, tunnel lifecycle
# beside tunnel state) and moved every exporter-pipeline counter to the health
# dashboard. Do not reintroduce the domain: a panel arriving here belongs to a
# subsystem, and if no subsystem claims it, that is the finding.

# The self-observability dashboard (#431), re-laid-out by #523.
#
# It launched deliberately flat — two tabs, one of them an eleven-row "Diagnostics",
# on the reasoning that an operator opening it because something is already wrong
# should not have to click into a domain first. That reasoning did not survive the
# tab count: eleven rows is not a fast read, and #523 moved three more subjects here
# (the flow pipeline, the derived-metric budget, recording rules). So it now carries
# the same shape as the main dashboard — an Overview of tiles that answer "is the
# exporter healthy" without scrolling, then domains for the detail behind each tile.
#
# The original concern is answered by the Overview rather than abandoned: every tile
# on it links to the tab holding its detail, so "something is wrong" is still one
# click from the panels that say what.
#
# "Recording rules" is top-level rather than inside a domain because it is the one
# tab here that is not about the exporter: it shows the bundled rules' OUTPUT, which
# is firewall data in precomputed form. It sits on this dashboard because every panel
# restates a raw System/Interfaces/Firewall panel, so on the operational dashboard it
# was duplication; here it answers "are my recording rules actually evaluating?".
# "Exporter Runtime" and "Recording rules" are top-level rather than each sitting in
# a domain of its own: a parent tab holding exactly one child is a click that shows

    """Catalogue metrics referenced by NO panel across the whole dashboard family.

    Variadic rather than single-Builder because the gate asks "is this metric
    visible to an operator anywhere", not "is it on this particular file" (#431).
    Scoping it to one Builder made splitting content structurally impossible: the
    moment a panel moved to a second dashboard its metric read as MISSING on the
    first, so the self-observability split could not land without either weakening
    the gate or exempting every metric it moved. Taking the union costs nothing
    while there is one dashboard and is the whole unblock once there are two.

    ACCEPTED LIMITATION, recorded here so it is not re-derived (#591 blind spot 4):
    this is a SUBSTRING match over one flat blob of every expression, not a semantic
    one. It proves the metric name appears in some query. It does NOT prove an
    operator can ever see the result — a panel on a row whose presence sentinel is
    never satisfied, a hidden panel, or a series blanked by a `> 0` guard all count
    as coverage here. That is deliberate: the alternative is evaluating conditional
    rendering against a hypothetical firewall, which needs a fixture of what that
    firewall exports and would fail for every optional plugin nobody in the fixture
    runs. The gate's real claim is the narrower one — "no metric was forgotten
    entirely" — and it is worth having at that strength. Do NOT widen it by adding
    per-panel visibility heuristics; the honest fix is a live-box check, which is
    what `cmd/apidrift` is for.

    The complementary direction — a panel querying a metric that cannot exist — is
    `panel_metric_gaps()` below, not this function.

    IT READS `_exprs`, WHICH IS PANEL QUERIES ONLY, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING (#619).
    `sentinel()` appends to `self.variables` and never to `_exprs`, so a presence
    variable's `label_values()` call does NOT count as coverage. That is the
    difference between "this metric reaches a panel an operator can look at" and
    "this metric is mentioned somewhere in the document". The sibling project made
    exactly that mistake (rknightion/tailscale2otel#527): a signal satisfied its
    every-signal-reaches-a-panel bar while appearing on no panel at all, because a
    hidden sentinel probing it counted.

    This is stated rather than left implicit because it is one refactor away from
    being untrue — anything that starts recording variable queries into `_exprs`,
    or that switches this to a walk over the whole serialised dashboard, silently
    converts this gate into one that cannot fail.

    * `_bucket` / `_sum` / `_count` are histogram and summary CHILD series. Tried as
      the literal token FIRST and only then stripped, so a metric genuinely named
      `..._count` (`opnsense_firmware_upgrade_packages_count`) is matched on its own
      name and never mangled into a nonexistent base.
    * `opnsense_instance` is a LABEL, and appears in every `by (...)` clause and

    count as coverage for per-program SYSLOG FORMATS. A cron line, an radvd line and a
    miniupnpd failure variant are shapes WITHIN the `syslog` source, they are all
