// Self-observability for the /metrics handler itself (#426). Before this, a
// stuck admission cap or a persistently duplicate-labelled collector was

// signal that scrapes were being rejected or served partial. Every name below
// is a literal constant so the self-metric inventory's source scan
// (scripts/docgen/selfmetrics.go) can see it; see that file's header for why an
// unresolvable name is a hard build failure rather than a skip.
//
// Label vocabularies are closed by construction, never derived from a request:
// requestStatus* and the reject/gather-error reasons are the only values these
// metrics can ever carry, so cardinality is bounded regardless of client
// behaviour (no path, no client IP, no header value ever becomes a label).

// registerer is what actually makes the series visible; a nil registerer (as
// in most unit tests) leaves the same Inc()/Observe() calls as harmless no-ops
// on unregistered collectors.
//
// SELF-REFERENTIAL BY CONSTRUCTION, DOCUMENTED RATHER THAN FOUGHT (#426): these
// metrics are gathered from the SAME registry the /metrics handler serves, so
// requestsInFlight is incremented before promhttp.HandlerFor runs and is
// therefore always >= 1 (never 0) in the very response that reports it — the
// scrape collecting the gauge is itself one of the in-flight requests it
// counts. Do not "fix" this with a snapshot-before-increment trick: it would
// only relocate the same fencepost by one request, and the collection path
// must never itself register a new label combination (a metric whose own
// Collect() mutates cardinality is worse than an off-by-one gauge).
