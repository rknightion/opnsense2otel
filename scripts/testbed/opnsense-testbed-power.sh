# OPNsense testbed power scheduler for `oli` (#625).
#
# The six testbed guests are only needed for on-demand live validation, but
# they would otherwise run 24/7 costing ~0.38 of a core and 24 GB of allocated
# RAM. The main session raises them with `up <hold>` when it needs a live API
# surface and takes them down after; opnsense-testbed-down.timer is the daily
# backstop for a lab left running.
#
# WHY THIS RUNS ON THE HOST AND NOT IN GITHUB ACTIONS: powering the lab from
# `live-canary.yml` would need a Proxmox API token and a `tag:ci -> oli:8006`
# ACL grant reachable from a PUBLIC repo, and a cancelled CI run would leave
# guests in an indeterminate power state. Neither is true of a host-side timer,
# and the lab gets a real warm-up instead of the ~10 minutes a CI-driven power
# cycle would give. Since the cron came off live-canary.yml the run is started BY
# this host (opnsense-testbed-canary-dispatch.sh) once `up` returns, so the warm-up
# is bounded by readiness rather than by a clock.
#
# ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING. Every guest except the two firewalls depends on a
# firewall for DHCP, routing and DNS, so the firewalls start first and stop
# last. Start a client before its firewall and it comes up with no lease — the
# canary then reads an empty box and files it as drift.
