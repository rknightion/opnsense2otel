# Integration & Dashboards

This guide covers integrating opnsense2otel with Prometheus and Grafana, including scrape configuration, dashboard import, and practical PromQL queries.

## Prometheus scrape configuration

Add the following scrape job to your `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: opnsense
    scrape_interval: 30s
    scrape_timeout: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - "exporter-host:8080"
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: instance
        replacement: "my-firewall"
```

### Multi-instance configuration

If you monitor multiple OPNsense firewalls, add a target for each exporter instance:

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: opnsense
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - "exporter-primary:8080"
        labels:
          firewall: primary
      - targets:
          - "exporter-secondary:8081"
        labels:
          firewall: secondary
```

### Prometheus Operator

See the [Kubernetes deployment guide](deployment/kubernetes.md) for `ScrapeConfig` and `ServiceMonitor` examples.

## Grafana dashboard

!!! warning "Minimum Grafana version: 13+ — and Grafana 12 fails silently"
    The dashboard uses the v2 dynamic schema (`dashboard.grafana.app/v2`) with `TabsLayout` and `conditionalRendering`, which require **Grafana 13 or later**. There is deliberately no schema-v1 build: the show/hide behaviour is the point of this dashboard, and classic schema cannot express it, so a converted copy would render every plugin-gated tab permanently empty — indistinguishable from a broken exporter.

    Know what an older Grafana does with it before you try, because two of the three routes do not tell you (verified against pinned `grafana/grafana` containers, 2026-07-27):

    | Grafana | route | result |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 11.5.0 | `POST /api/dashboards/db` | **400** `Dashboard title cannot be empty` — v2 keeps the title under `spec`, so the error names a symptom, not the cause |
    | 12.4.0 | `POST /api/dashboards/db` | **200**, and the dashboard then renders **0 panels and 0 variables**. The v2 body is stored verbatim and ignored — no error anywhere |
    | 12.4.0 | `POST /apis/dashboard.grafana.app/...` | **400** `no kind "Dashboard" is registered for version "dashboard.grafana.app/v2"` |

    An empty dashboard on Grafana 12 is not a broken export; it is the version. Upgrade to Grafana 13.

Two cross-linked Grafana dashboards cover **all 1090 metrics across 57 tabs** (<!-- docgen:begin:dashboard-tabs -->
Overview, Config, System & Resources, Memory & Storage, Firmware & Backup, Hardware & SMART, Kernel Memory, Services, Cron & DynDNS, Certificates, UPS, Monit, HA Sync, CARP / HA, Interfaces, Gateways & WAN, DNS - Unbound, DNS - Unbound Lists, DHCP, DHCP - ISC & Client, Routing & Neighbors, Protocol Stats, Protocol Stats - IP, NTP, Chrony, Traffic Shaper, NetFlow, Flow Volume, FRR Routing, FRR - OSPF, Captive Portal, Firewall & PF, Firewall Rules & NAT, Authentication & Audit, Aliases, IDS/IPS, CrowdSec, ClamAV, Q-Feeds, Zenarmor, VPN, VPN - IPsec, Tailscale, NetBird, Tor, Syslog, HAProxy, Relayd, Nginx, Siproxd, Overview, Scrape & Poll, OPNsense API, Metrics & OTLP, Log Shipping, Flow Pipeline, Exporter Runtime, Recording rules
<!-- docgen:end:dashboard-tabs -->). Tabs and rows auto show/hide based on which metrics your exporter emits, so unused collectors and absent OPNsense plugins disappear automatically.

### Import the dashboard

1. Open Grafana and navigate to **Dashboards > New > Import**.
2. Import the JSON files from the repository: `grafana/dashboard.json` (the firewall) and
   `grafana/dashboard-health.json` (the exporter's own health). Import both — the operational
   dashboard's exporter-health summary links to the companion.
3. Select your Prometheus data source and click **Import**.

The dashboard uses template variables for `datasource`, `opnsense_instance`, and `interface`. See [`grafana/README.md`](https://github.com/rknightion/opnsense2otel/blob/main/grafana/README.md) for `gcx`/GitOps deployment and the bundled alert and recording rules.

### Event annotations

Every tab shares one event timeline, so a step in a graph can be attributed without leaving the panel. Sixteen layers ship, each toggleable from the dashboard controls.

| Layer | Marks | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reboot | Every counter on the box resetting at once | `opnsense_system_boot_timestamp_seconds` |
| Config change | A configuration being applied | `opnsense_system_config_last_change_timestamp_seconds` |
| Interface counter reset | One interface's counters restarting | boot instant + `opnsense_interfaces_attach_or_statistics_reset_uptime_seconds` |
| Boot environment created | An OPNsense upgrade | `opnsense_snapshots_active_created_timestamp_seconds` |
| Certificate renewed | Services reloading behind a new certificate | `opnsense_acme_certificate_last_update_timestamp_seconds` |
| GeoIP database updated | Country rules matching differently | `opnsense_firewall_geoip_last_update_timestamp_seconds` |
| nginx config reloaded | nginx's vts counters zeroing | `opnsense_nginx_config_load_timestamp_seconds` |
| Public IP updated | The WAN address changing | `opnsense_dyndns_account_last_update_timestamp_seconds` |
| IDS ruleset updated | Alert rate changing under a static config | `opnsense_ids_ruleset_last_updated_timestamp_seconds` |
| Threat feed updated (off) | Blocklist contents changing | `opnsense_qfeeds_feed_last_update_timestamp_seconds` |
| Gateway alarm | `dpinger` declaring a gateway down or recovered | shipped `gateways` log records |
| CARP transition | A failover, demotion or promotion | shipped `kernel` log records |
| Config change detail | Which API endpoint changed the config | shipped `audit` log records |
| Tunnel lifecycle | A VPN tunnel coming up or going down | shipped `vpn`/`ipsec` log records |
| Exporter-pushed events | Everything above, as written by the exporter | Grafana's annotation store, tag `opnsense2otel` |
| External change events | Changes your own automation records | Grafana's annotation store, deployment-local tags |

The metric-sourced layers place their marker at the metric's **value** (Grafana's
`useValueForTime`), not at the scrape that observed it, so a reboot annotation sits at the real boot
instant rather than up to a poll interval later. The log-sourced layers use the record's own
syslog timestamp and require [log shipping](configuration.md) to be enabled; without it they are
simply empty. A collector you have disabled produces no series and therefore no annotation — absent,
not noisy.

The most common use is the one metrics alone cannot answer: a new firewall rule starts dropping
traffic, every rate panel steps down at once, and the Config change marker is what distinguishes
"someone changed something" from "the network broke". Enable **Config change detail** to see that the
change came from `/api/firewall/filter/addRule`.

#### Let the exporter write the annotations

The layers above derive events from data this dashboard already queries, so they cost nothing and
need no configuration. Their limit is that they only exist here. Turning on `--annotations.enabled`
makes the exporter write the same events into Grafana's own annotation store, so they also appear on
**any other dashboard** that queries the tag, in Explore, and beside your alerts:

```bash
opnsense2otel \
  --annotations.enabled \
  --annotations.grafana-url=https://mystack.grafana.net \
  --annotations.token=<token>          # or OPN2OTEL_ANNOTATIONS_TOKEN_FILE
```

The token is a Grafana service-account token needing only the annotation write permission. This is the
exporter's only outbound write, which is why it is off by default.

Each annotation is stamped with the event's own timestamp rather than the moment it was noticed, is
tagged `opnsense2otel` plus the event kind and `instance:<name>`, and is reconciled against what
is already in Grafana on startup so a restart neither duplicates nor loses events. Nothing is written
for an event older than `--annotations.lookback` (default 24h), so enabling it on a long-running
firewall does not backfill a reboot from months ago. Watch
`opnsense_exporter_annotations_written_total` and `opnsense_exporter_annotations_failed_total` to
confirm it is working — a quiet firewall legitimately writes nothing for days.

**Which kinds are written.** The default push set is every kind above except the ones the dashboard
itself defaults off, currently `threat-feed-update` — Q-Feeds refreshes every twenty minutes or so,
and a pushed annotation is org-wide, so it would land on every dashboard and beside every alert.
`--annotations.kinds` overrides that in both directions and is the exact set once given:

```bash
--annotations.kinds=reboot --annotations.kinds=config-change   # only these two
--annotations.kinds=threat-feed-update,...                     # env var form is comma-separated
```

**`Exporter-pushed events` is a catch-all**, not a per-kind layer: it queries the single
`opnsense2otel` tag, so it shows every kind the exporter writes regardless of the per-kind
toggles above, which govern the derived layers only. That is why what gets pushed is controlled at
the exporter rather than on the dashboard.

## Example PromQL queries

### Gateway monitoring

**Gateway availability overview:**

```promql
opnsense_gateways_status
```

**Gateway alarm transitions from `dpinger`:**

```promql
sum by (opnsense_instance, gateway, event) (
  rate(opnsense_log_events_gateway_total{event=~"alarm_started|alarm_cleared"}[5m])
)
```

The Gateways & WAN tab puts this transition rate beside the current gateway-state
timeline. `event` is closed to `alarm_started` (`none -> down`) and
`alarm_cleared` (`down -> none`); the metric has no address, RTT or loss labels.
The Grafana-managed `OPNsenseGatewayAlarmFlapping` warning alerts when one gateway
has three or more `alarm_started` events in 15 minutes. It is transition evidence,
not a claim that the gateway is currently down.

**CARP transitions from the FreeBSD kernel:**

```promql
sum by (opnsense_instance, event, from, to, interface, vhid) (
  rate(opnsense_log_events_carp_total[5m])
)
```

The CARP / HA tab puts this beside the CARP VIP Status timeline: that shows the state
now, this shows the transitions that produced it. `event` is closed to `state_changed`,
`demoted` and `promoted`; `from` and `to` are closed to `master`, `backup` and `init`.
A demotion names neither an interface nor a VHID, so `from`, `to`, `interface` and
`vhid` are empty on those series, and `demoted` versus `promoted` is decided by the
sign of the kernel's demotion delta. The kernel's **cause** is not a label — read it
from `carp.reason` on the shipped log record, with `carp.demotion.delta` and
`carp.demotion.total`. Two Grafana-managed warnings cover it:
`OPNsenseCARPStateFlapping` on four or more state changes for one vhid in 15 minutes
(a clean failover is two, and does not fire), and `OPNsenseCARPUnexpectedDemotion` on
any sustained rate of `event="demoted"`.

**Average RTT per gateway over 5 minutes:**

```promql
avg_over_time(opnsense_gateways_rtt_milliseconds[5m])
```

**Gateways with packet loss above 1%:**

```promql
opnsense_gateways_loss_percentage > 1
```

### Firewall traffic analysis

**Total pass packets per second by interface:**

```promql
sum by (interface) (
  rate(opnsense_firewall_in_ipv4_pass_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_out_ipv4_pass_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_in_ipv6_pass_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_out_ipv6_pass_packets_total[5m])
)
```

**Block rate by interface:**

```promql
sum by (interface) (
  rate(opnsense_firewall_in_ipv4_block_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_out_ipv4_block_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_in_ipv6_block_packets_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_firewall_out_ipv6_block_packets_total[5m])
)
```

**Firewall state table utilization:**

```promql
opnsense_firewall_pf_states_current / opnsense_firewall_pf_states_limit * 100
```

### System resources

**Memory usage percentage:**

```promql
opnsense_system_memory_used_bytes / opnsense_system_memory_total_bytes * 100
```

**Load average trend (1-min):**

```promql
opnsense_system_load_average_one_minute
```

**Disk usage by device:**

```promql
opnsense_system_disk_used_ratio * 100
```

### Certificate expiry alerting

**Days until certificate expiry:**

```promql
(opnsense_certificate_valid_to_timestamp_seconds - time()) / 86400
```

**Certificates expiring within 14 days:**

```promql
(opnsense_certificate_valid_to_timestamp_seconds - time()) / 86400 < 14
  and
(opnsense_certificate_valid_to_timestamp_seconds - time()) > 0
```

### DNS performance

**Unbound query rate:**

```promql
rate(opnsense_unbound_dns_queries_total[5m])
```

**DNS cache hit ratio:**

```promql
rate(opnsense_unbound_dns_cache_hits_total[5m])
/ (
  rate(opnsense_unbound_dns_cache_hits_total[5m])
  + rate(opnsense_unbound_dns_cache_misses_total[5m])
) * 100
```

### VPN monitoring

**WireGuard peer transfer rates:**

```promql
rate(opnsense_wireguard_peer_received_bytes_total[5m])
```

**IPsec tunnel status:**

```promql
opnsense_ipsec_phase1_status
```

### High-availability

**CARP VIP status (MASTER=1, BACKUP=2, INIT=0):**

```promql
opnsense_carp_vip_status
```

**CARP demotion counter (non-zero indicates issues):**

```promql
opnsense_carp_demotion_counter > 0
```

### NTP health

**NTP offset across all peers:**

```promql
opnsense_ntp_offset_milliseconds
```

**NTP peers with poor reachability:**

```promql
opnsense_ntp_reachability < 255
```

### Temperature alerts

**High temperature alert (above 75C):**

```promql
opnsense_temperature_celsius > 75
```

## Alerting rules

Example Prometheus alerting rules for OPNsense monitoring:

```yaml title="opnsense-alerts.yml"
groups:
  - name: opnsense
    rules:
      - alert: OPNsenseDown
        expr: opnsense_up == 0
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "OPNsense exporter cannot reach {{ $labels.opnsense_instance }}"

      - alert: OPNsenseGatewayDown
        expr: opnsense_gateways_status != 1
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Gateway {{ $labels.gateway }} is down on {{ $labels.opnsense_instance }}"

      - alert: OPNsenseCertExpiringSoon
        expr: (opnsense_certificate_valid_to_timestamp_seconds - time()) / 86400 < 14
        for: 1h
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Certificate {{ $labels.description }} expires in {{ $value | humanize }} days"

      - alert: OPNsenseHighMemory
        expr: opnsense_system_memory_used_bytes / opnsense_system_memory_total_bytes > 0.9
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Memory usage above 90% on {{ $labels.opnsense_instance }}"

      - alert: OPNsenseHighTemperature
        expr: opnsense_temperature_celsius > 80
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Temperature {{ $value }}C on {{ $labels.device }} ({{ $labels.opnsense_instance }})"
```

## Complementary exporters

opnsense2otel focuses on OPNsense-specific metrics. For complete visibility, consider running these alongside it:

- **[node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)** -- Install on the OPNsense firewall itself for OS-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network). opnsense2otel provides OPNsense-specific views of some of these, but node_exporter offers deeper system-level detail.
- **[blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter)** -- Probe endpoints through the firewall to verify connectivity and measure latency from the network edge.
