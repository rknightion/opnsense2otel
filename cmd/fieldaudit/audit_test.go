// an OPNsense response and never read in production code. The audit must surface
// every one of them; they are the regression set for the analysis itself, quite
// apart from whether the ledger then exempts them.
// The set shrinks as the audit's own findings get acted on: OrganizationName
// (#557), Driver and HWOffloadCapabilities (#555) were all on this list and are
// now read in production, so keeping them here would assert the opposite of what
// is true.
//
// Whatever sits here must have ONE property: its field NAME is read elsewhere on
// a different type, so a textual scan would wrongly conclude this instance is
// read too. That is what proves the analysis is type-aware rather than grepping,
// so never empty this list and never replace the entry with a field whose name
// is unique.
//
// ndpEntry.Expire held the slot until OPN-0113 deleted the field outright.
// interfaceConfigEntry.Device replaces it: ".Device" is read in roughly 160
// places across opnsense/ and internal/ (NDPEntry.Device among them), while this
// one cannot be read by construction — FetchInterfaceEnumeration hand-walks the
// raw JSON to preserve key order (#361) and never decodes into the type at all.
