// The live-box coverage ledger (#377).
//
// ValidateResponseSchema files a path it could not reach — because the array
// above it was empty, the map was empty, or the value was null — into
// Unverified. That is box state, not drift, so it deliberately never makes a
// result unclean. The problem the ledger solves is the other half: a path that
// backs an exported metric and is NEVER exercised is source-derived, possibly
// wrong, and permanently green in CI, and "20 endpoints have unverifiable
// paths" gives nobody anything to act on.
//
// So the ledger classifies selected endpoint/path pairs into exactly two
// classes and nothing else is reclassified: an unledgered unverified path stays
// informational, as it was.
//
// THE COST OF THAT OPT-IN, and why the ledger is HAND-MAINTAINED (#599). The
// seam above cuts both ways: a path that backs an exported metric and is not
// ledgered is reported as informational noise rather than as required coverage.
// #599 audited all 100 paths the #531 canary run left in that bucket against
// the collectors; 67 backed a metric and are now ledgered, 33 did not and were
// deliberately left informational. Four kinds of "did not", recorded so the
// verdicts are not re-litigated: array/element CONTAINERS (rows[], items[],
// items[].flows[]) carry no value and resolve with the leaves under them; DEAD
// fields decoded and never read (cmd/fieldaudit already names these); fields
// consumed only by the LOG pipeline, not by a metric (idsQueryAlerts' seven
// eve-record fields, unboundSearchQueries' uuid) — this ledger's required class
// means "backs an emitted METRIC", and widening it to log attributes would be a
// change to its contract, not an audit finding; and fields whose consumer is
// CALL-SITE-GATED off (keaLeases4's rows[].type, whose v4 call site passes a nil
// descriptor; keaSubnets4's rows[].uuid, read only on the v6 PD-pool join).
//
// That audit is NOT automated, and deliberately so. Deriving "this JSON path
// backs metric X" mechanically means tracing a schema path to a struct field in
// this package, through Fetch* normalisation, into internal/collector, and on to
// a *prometheus.Desc built in Register from a subsystem constant — and the two
// tractable approximations both fail in a way that forces the ledger to lie:
//
//   - A dataflow/taint analysis MISSES the highest-value cases outright, because
//     several fields reach no metric by dataflow at all. They are row-validity
//     PREDICATES: openVPNSessions' is_client, ipsecSad's spi, wireguardClients'
//     and trafficShaperStatistics' type, trafficShaperStatistics' template. Each
//     decides whether a row becomes a metric at all, so a rename makes an entire
//     metric family silently read zero on a healthy firewall. Those are exactly
//     the entries worth having, and a dataflow gate reports them clean.
//   - Making it sound instead OVER-claims, because whole-struct conversions
//     (`data.Rows = append(data.Rows, Sessions{...})`) make every field of a
//     struct reachable from every metric that reads any field of it —
//     cmd/fieldaudit documents that same sharp edge for its own analysis. The
//     only ways to keep such a gate green are to weaken it or to write entries
//     naming metrics they do not back, and an entry that names no real metric is
//     worse than no entry.
//
// It is also genuinely semantic in places: the call-site-gated verdicts above
// invert if the analysis is not per-call-site sensitive. So the derivation stays
// a documented manual step, run when a canary report names paths in the
// unclassified bucket. What IS automated is the honest half — verifying the
// human's claim rather than deriving it: TestCoverageLedgerNamesRealMetrics
// (cmd/apidrift) resolves every metric name in this ledger against the live
// collector registry, so a required entry can no longer protect a family that
// was renamed, deleted or mistyped.
//
//   - required — the path backs an emitted metric, so the canary is EXPECTED to
//     exercise it. While it is unverified the run warns, and the report names
//     the metric it protects, how to exercise it on the testbed, and the current
//     blocker. Warning-level, never breaking.
//   - stateOptional — legitimate hardware/licence/topology state a VM cannot
//     produce (a PSU rail, a GPS receiver, SFP diagnostics, ZFS ARC, a
//     temperature sensor). Informational, with a reason and a prune trigger, so
//     the class cannot quietly become a dumping ground.
//
// A ledger path is a NORMALIZED schema path — array elements are "[]" and a Go
// map's dynamic keys are "*" — exactly as reported by the validator, so no
// hostname, peer identity or interface name can enter the ledger. It takes the
// same two forms as a MissingOK entry: an exact path, or a "prefix.*" subtree.

// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why neither existing knob would do. A path can be
// metric-backing and exercisable on one probe target while being permanently
// unreachable on another. The case that built this was the prod profile, retired
// by OPN-0106: the production firewall had no CARP VIP, no Kea DHCPv4 subnet, no
// DHCPv6 PD pool and no WireGuard instance, all four of which would have needed
// config WRITES on a box whose standing authorisation was read-only, so it
// reported 15 required-coverage warnings that could never clear (#531). The two
// lab boxes do not carry identical plugin sets either, so the scoping still has
// work to do.
//
// An exemption is not the alternative, and this is checked in code rather than
// assumed: missingOK is consulted only in the `absentFinal > 0 && !unverifiable`
// branch and suppresses ValidationResult.Missing (schema_validate.go), while an
// EMPTY PARENT ARRAY - what prod returned for all four - files its children under
// ValidationResult.Unverified with no missingOK check, and the coverage ledger
// reads that. And the two knobs that do reach here, base `stateOptional` and
// `opaque`, are both base-scoped: either would blind every target on paths a
// sibling box verifies today, which is strictly worse than the warning.
//
// The override is a RE-CLASS, not an additive list, which is the one structural
// difference from SchemaExemption.Profiles: an exemption profile appends more
// exempt paths, whereas here the entry already exists and only its severity
// differs per target. It therefore carries its own Reason and PruneTrigger,
// enforced by TestCommittedCoverageLedgerIntegrity exactly as a base
// stateOptional entry's are - an override with no reason is an unexplained blind
// spot on one target, which is HARDER to notice than a base one because the
// other two profiles keep verifying the path and the ledger reads healthy.
