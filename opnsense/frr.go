// VERIFICATION: bgpsummary/ospfoverview/searchOspfneighbor/bfd* below were
// re-verified 2026-07-13 against a real os-frr dev-box lab (see #195/#197/#198/
// #199 dev-box validation checklists) — an eBGP session AS65001<->AS65002 and an
// OSPFv2 Full/DR adjacency, both bounced at least once. The BGP/OSPFv2/BFD shapes
// and field names below match the live captures.
//
// The OSPFv3 (ospf6) structs added for #198 were source-derived for a long time
// because no live v3 adjacency could be brought up. That gap is CLOSED as of
// 2026-07-25 (#377): OSPFv3 was enabled on the dev box and a Full adjacency
// established across the isolated testbed bridge, and all 13 ospf6 field names
// below were confirmed present in the live payload — routerId,
// numberOfAsScopedLsa, areas and areas.*.numberOfAreaScopedLsa on the overview;
// status, type, areaId, cost, priority, ospf6InterfaceState,
// numberOfInterfaceScopedLsa, pendingLsaLsUpdateCount and pendingLsaLsAckCount
// per interface. ospf6InterfaceState returns a real non-Down value (BDR) on the
// adjacency-bearing interface.
//
// Why the earlier attempts failed, recorded so it is not re-investigated: the
// Proxmox HOST kernel is booted with ipv6.disable=1, so /proc/sys/net/ipv6 is
// absent in every namespace on that host and no LXC there can ever run an IPv6
// stack. That is a host-kernel property, not the container-privilege issue #227
// concluded. A VM (own kernel) works fine on the same bridge.
//
// CORRECTION (#459, closed 2026-07-27 by 0a24a5a): this block used to say these
// two endpoints "remain INVISIBLE TO THE CANARY regardless". That is no longer
// true. schema_registry.go registered the envelope types, whose sole field is
// `Response json.RawMessage` → KindAny, so the derived golden carried one path
// and accepted any payload. envelopeDescent now names the second decode stage
// explicitly, so the reflector sees through the envelope and the inner paths are
// checked like any other.
//
// The visible consequence, recorded because it looked alarming and was not: the
// first canary run after that landed reported ~130 "unexpected nested keys"
// across the six quagga endpoints at once. Upstream had not changed. The canary
// had simply stopped being blind, and those paths were always there. They are
// ledgered in exemptions.json now (#496). Do not read a future bulk finding on a
// newly-unwrapped envelope as drift without checking whether the reflector's
// reach changed first.
//
//   - bgpsummary: per-AF field set, numeric types (remoteAs may exceed int32) — verified
//   - bgpneighbors: per-peer flap/message/AF-prefix detail — verified (#197)
//   - ospfoverview: areas key structure; nbrFullAdjacentCounter is the sole
//     spelling FRR has ever emitted — the "nbrFullAdjacencyCount" it was once
//     paired against was a phantom, pruned by #598 (see frrOSPFAreaData)
//   - ospfinterface: per-interface detail — verified ("interfaces"-wrapped shape, FRR>=8, this box's FRR 10.3); older flat top-level shape is decoded tolerantly but unverified live
//   - ospfv3overview/ospfv3interface: field names VERIFIED against a live v3 adjacency 2026-07-25 (#377); canary-visible since #459
//   - searchOspfneighbor: old vs new field names (state/nbrState, address/ifaceAddress) — verified
//   - bfdneighbors/bfdcounters: peer-keyed map structure, uptime field presence
//
// CORRECTION (#480, 2026-07-28): the "field names below match the live captures"
// claim above did NOT hold for bfdcounters. Two of its five fields were tagged
// "session-up-events"/"session-down-events", which FRR has never emitted on any
// release, so they decoded to zero on every real box while the hand-written
// fixture — which encoded the same invented names — kept the unit test green.
// The live-box canary caught it only because it reported the two tagged names as
// missing and FRR's real "session-up"/"session-down" as unexpected extras on the
// same response. Verify BFD field names against FRR's bfdd/bfdd_vty.c, not
// against OPNsense: the quagga plugin is a pure vtysh passthrough and renames
// nothing.
//
// #582 (2026-07-31): the OSPF-neighbor/SPF-timing fields ledgered as
// opportunities in exemptions.json were verified against FRRouting/frr master
// (ospfd/ospf_vty.c show_ip_ospf_neighbour_brief ~5180-5234, ospfd/ospf_dump_api.c
// ospf_nsm_state_msg, ospfd/ospf_vty.c ~3451-3463, ospf6d/ospf6_top.c ~1309-1326,
// ospf6d/ospf6_area.c ~498-517, ospf6d/ospf6_interface.c ~1222-1263) rather than
// assumed, and two of that ledger's OPPORTUNITY notes turned out to describe the
// wrong shape:
//
//   - "converged" is NOT a boolean convergence flag despite the name — it is the
//     neighbor's raw NSM state name (ospf_nsm_state_msg: DependUpon/Deleted/Down/
//     Attempt/Init/2-Way/ExStart/Exchange/Loading/Full), the same value baked into
//     the existing "Full/DR"-style nbrState/state string minus its ISM suffix.
//     Modeled as a single always-1 info gauge keyed by the state string (the same
//     shape as bfdPeerDiagnosticInfo below), not an 8-way enum: the existing
//     ospf_neighbor_adjacency binary flag already answers "is it Full", so the
//     gap this closes is "what is it stuck at when it isn't" — a label, not a
//     fixed enum set fanned out per neighbor.
//   - OSPFv3's instance-level "spfLastExecutedMsecs" (ospf6_top.c:1315) is a
//     json_object_STRING_add of a formatted duration, NOT a millisecond number
//     like OSPFv2's field of the same name — there is no numeric sibling for it
//     at the instance level. The numeric SPF-age reading only exists PER AREA
//     (ospf6_area.c's areas.*.spfLastExecutedSecs + areas.*.spfLastExecutedMicroSecs,
//     a genuine (whole-seconds, microseconds-remainder) pair), so the v3 SPF-age
//     gauge below is area-labeled, unlike v2's instance-level one. OSPFv3's
//     instance-level "spfLastDurationMsecs" (ospf6_top.c:1324-1326) IS numeric —
//     but it is o->ts_spf_duration.tv_usec, i.e. genuinely MICROSECONDS despite
//     the "Msecs" name (struct timeval's second field is always usec); pair it
//     with the sibling spfLastDurationSecs, never divide it by 1000 as if it were
//     milliseconds.
//
// Also verified: quaggaOspfv3Interface's pendingLsaLsUpdateTime/pendingLsaLsAckTime
// (ospf6_interface.c ~1224-1263) are NOT a numeric queue-age sibling of the
// already-modeled pendingLsaLs{Update,Ack}Count scalars, contrary to that ledger
// entry's OPPORTUNITY note. They are json_object_string_add-only formatted
// countdowns to the interface's next scheduled LSA flood/ack SEND (sands-now via
// thread_send_lsupdate/thread_send_lsack), computed unconditionally (timerclear()
// zeroes the timeval when no send is scheduled) — a different signal (send-timer
// due) than "how long has this been queued", and available only as a string this
// codebase has no parser for (the same reason OSPFv2's upTime/deadTime strings
// are decoded-and-discarded below in favor of their numeric siblings). NOT
// modeled here; see the #582 implementation report for the open question this
// leaves.
