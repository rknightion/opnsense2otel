"""
Flow Volume tab — byte and packet volume rolled up from flow records
(opnsense_flow_*, the flow collector, #346).

Phase 1's source is the Zenarmor receiver's conn documents; phase 2 adds a NetFlow
v5/v9 receiver producing the same normalized record. This answers volume questions
from metrics — bytes and packets by interface, direction, transport, application
category, verdict and scope — instead of scanning 4-6 GB/day of Loki.

Two things a reader of these panels has to know, both stated on the panels
themselves rather than only here:

  * __other__ is the folded remainder, not an interface/category/direction. Keys
    beyond --flow.top-n fold into one series per SOURCE, so the family still sums
    exactly at any limit. It keeps the source label precisely so the query below
    stays writable.
  * The family will carry TWO independent measurements of the same traffic once the
    NetFlow lane lands — Zenarmor measures what it inspects, NetFlow measures the
    packet path, and #346 decision 3 forbids summing them. Every volume query here
    therefore aggregates BY source rather than over it, so it is already correct
    when the second source appears.

The last row is the LOG drilldown (#592 item 1 / #591 item 5), and it is here rather
than on Flow Pipeline deliberately: Flow Pipeline is the exporter watching its own
ingest machinery, while the question this row answers — "WAN egress is at 400 Mbit,
which conversation is it?" — is asked by an operator standing in front of these
volume panels, usually because `instance:opnsense_flow_bytes:rate5m` just alerted.
Every panel above is an aggregate by construction (host and application NAME are
unbounded and can never be metric labels), so before this row the drilldown simply
ended there, even though the exporter already ships src.ip, dst.ip, app.name and
flow.community_id on one record per connection-window.

# match folded L7 in. They are selected TOGETHER because an operator asking which
# conversation moved the bytes does not know in advance which lane produced it — and
# splitting them would hide exactly the un-correlated half.
#
# Unlike the unbound/ids/crowdsec lanes, this one DOES stamp a subsystem
# (logship.AttrSubsystem = "flow", set by internal/logship/flowlog). It is not used
# here: Zenarmor's own receiver also ships subsystem="flow" records, which are its
