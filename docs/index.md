**Prometheus and OpenTelemetry metrics for OPNsense firewalls**

A Prometheus exporter that polls OPNsense REST APIs and exposes 1047 metrics across 82 concurrent collectors: firewall statistics, network interfaces, gateways, VPN tunnels, DHCP leases, DNS resolver stats, system resources, hardware temperatures, certificate expiry, and more. It also pushes native OpenTelemetry metrics and logs over OTLP, receives and enriches syslog, and turns NetFlow and Zenarmor records into bounded flow-volume metrics.

## Quickstart

Create an OPNsense API user first ([permissions](getting-started.md)), then:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
      -e OPN2OTEL_OPS_API_KEY=your-api-key \
      -e OPN2OTEL_OPS_API_SECRET=your-api-secret \
      ghcr.io/rknightion/opnsense2otel:latest \
      --opnsense.protocol=https \
      --opnsense.address=ops.example.com \
      --web.ui-enabled=true
```

Metrics are then at `http://localhost:8080/metrics`, and the operator console at
`http://localhost:8080/`.

## About

opnsense2otel targets OPNsense specifically, covering the firewall, its plugin ecosystem, and the services running on it. It complements `node_exporter`: `node_exporter` has to run on the firewall itself, but this exporter can run on any machine with network access to the OPNsense API.

Key highlights:

- **82 collectors** covering every major OPNsense subsystem
- **Independent background polling** with snapshot replay for fast, API-free scrapes
- **High-availability support** with CARP/VIP monitoring
- **Opt-in high-cardinality metrics** for per-lease DHCP and per-rule firewall detail
- **File-based secrets** for credentials outside plain environment variables
- **Continuous profiling** (opt-in) pushed to Grafana Cloud Pyroscope

## What sets it apart

Most OPNsense exporters scrape a few endpoints and stop at `/metrics`. This one covers all four telemetry paths off the firewall:

- **Native OpenTelemetry** - push metrics *and* logs over OTLP to any collector or to Grafana Cloud, with no Prometheus scrape at all. See [configuration](configuration.md).
- **[Syslog receiver](syslog-receiver.md)** - the firewall pushes logs to the exporter, which parses `filterlog`, sshd, DHCP, HAProxy and Suricata lines and enriches them with rule descriptions, interface names and hostnames from the API. A generic collector can receive those lines; it cannot understand them.
- **[Zenarmor receiver](zenarmor-receiver.md)** - per-connection, DNS, TLS/SNI, HTTP and threat-alert records taken straight from Zenarmor by posing as its Elasticsearch streaming target. The only way to get that data off a Home-tier box, since Zenarmor's syslog export is licence-gated.
- **[NetFlow and flow volume](flow.md)** - a NetFlow v5/v9 receiver and Zenarmor connection records feed one bounded rollup, so traffic-volume questions are answerable from Prometheus for years instead of by scanning GB/day of logs.

!!! info "Fork notice"
    This began as a fork of [AthennaMind/opnsense-exporter](https://github.com/AthennaMind/opnsense-exporter) and became a hard fork early on, as its changes quickly grew incompatible with upstream. Credit to the original authors for the foundation this builds on. It now evolves independently; see the [changelog](changelog.md) for release history.
