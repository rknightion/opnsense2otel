This document carries **only what is specific to opnsense2otel**. The campaign model itself — run
modes, the routing contract, authority and the thread pool, child lane briefs, external-contract
freezing, the unattended blocker contract, the goal-file template, the pre-flight checklist — lives
in the *Agent fan-out protocol (canonical)* doc and is not repeated here. If something below could be
pasted into another repo unchanged, it is in the wrong document.

## Run-end against this tracker

The goal file does not enumerate the work. The queue is:

```bash
backlog task list --plain -s "To Do"
```

Task state is the record, not a report file:

- landed work is `Done` with the commit SHA in its final summary;
- blocked work is `Parked` with a concrete resume boundary — the next action, not "blocked on X";
- untouched work is self-evidently still `To Do`;
- discovered work is a new task labelled `needs-triage`.

The run's closing message goes to the terminal as a covering note: what did this run learn that no
single task captures. Nothing durable may live only there. Writing it is the last unit of work, not a
reply to a request.

Acceptance criteria live on the task, so a lane reads its own contract with
`backlog task view <id> --plain` and the goal file stops restating them.

## Gates

`backlog/config.yml`'s `definition_of_done` seeds every task with two gates:

```
just check
just gen        # only if a generated artifact changed; commit the diff
```

`just check` is the whole bare-toolchain gate and it is **not** the old five-command list. It runs
`fmt-check lint test metric-lint fuzz-smoke check-public-ips testbed-test canary-test grafana-test gen-check vuln`,
so the two conditional additions a lane used to have to remember — `grafana-test` when touching
`grafana/`, `testbed-test` / `canary-test` when touching `scripts/testbed/` or `scripts/canary/` —
are already inside it. There is nothing conditional left for a lane to add.

Every `make` target this repo once had is gone (OPN-0006). `make lint`, `make test`,
`make check-public-ips`, `make docs-check`, `make grafana-check` and `make grafana-test` do not
exist; a lane that reaches for one gets `command not found`, not a gate. Discover the surface with
`just --list`, never from memory.

The heavy CI-only gates — race-detector matrix, docker build, helm-in-kind, deployment contracts,
cross-compilation — are not a lane's job. `just ci` adds the subset that needs Docker or
cross-compilation locally. Do not skip a gate by claiming it is CI-only; say the change is untested
against it and let CI answer.

**auto-rc classifies only the head commit of a push.** Its `shipped-change` job diffs `HEAD^..HEAD`,
so a push whose last commit touches only `scripts/`, `docs/` or `backlog/` cuts no release candidate
even when the commits under it changed shipped Go. Push the shipped-code commit last, or on its own,
when a lane needs a candidate build (the FreeBSD receiver can only take a binary from a release URL).

**A major release needs the module path moved first.** `TestModulePathMatchesReleaseVersion` turns
the release-please PR red the moment the manifest passes the module's major; `just bump-module-major
major=<N>` is the repo's own rewrite and is a `[confirm]` recipe, so ask before running it. It also
rewrites `backlog/` task notes that quote old import paths; restore those, they are history.

### CodeRabbit: review the source, not the generated tree

**A whole-wave review does not fail, it disconnects.** Past about 100 files the CLI drops the
socket during the connect phase and emits
`{"type":"error","errorType":"connection","message":"Connection failed: WebSocket closed"}` with no
`complete` event. It never reaches analysis, so there is nothing to triage and nothing to retry
usefully — a second attempt fails identically. This is not a service outage and not an auth problem:
`coderabbit doctor` passes all nine checks while it happens, and a one-file review against the same
service, account and repository completes normally in the same minute.

Wave 2 read two of those as a hard gate failure and parked seven finished, gated, reviewed lanes.
The whole loss was avoidable.

**Split the review by what the review policy already covers.** Generated artifacts are outside the
gate anyway — `grafana/dashboard*.json`, `grafana/sentinel-contract.json`, `grafana/runbooks.md`,
`grafana/tabs/AUTHORING.md`, `grafana/alerts/grafana-managed/`, `opnsense/testdata/schemas/`,
`docs/`, `README.md`. On a wave-sized change those are most of the bytes and none of the branching:
in wave 2 they were 4,957 of 8,180 changed lines, `dashboard.json` alone 4,642. Reviewing the 48
source files completed and found six findings, two of them major.

Do it in a scratch worktree so the real checkout is never disturbed:

```bash
git worktree add -f --detach /tmp/cr-src origin/main
cd /tmp/cr-src && git apply <the wave patch>
# restore generated paths to base: checkout the tracked ones, rm the new ones
git add -A && coderabbit review --agent --base main
```

If the source slice is itself too large, split it again by package. Every changed source file must
appear in some completed review; record which review covered which files.

**A slice has one cost, and it is predictable:** a finding raised against a file you excluded is a
false positive, because the reviewer is reading a tree where that file was never updated. Wave 2's
`log-shipping.md` source-table finding was exactly this. Check any docs- or generated-file finding
against the real tree before acting on it.

## Exclusive resources — serialise these, never fan out across them

**The testbed is a single physical resource, and CI owns its power.** THREE guests on `oli`, off by
default: 102 (nightly firewall), 106 (release firewall) and 105 (the traffgen container, shared by
both profiles). 110, 111 and 112 were retired and DESTROYED on 2026-09-20 by OPN-0110; they are not
coming back, and a reference to them in an older task or comment is history.

`live-canary.yml` now raises the lab itself, brings both firewalls to their channel heads, probes,
and lowers it in an `always()` step, so the lab is up only for the run. A session does not have to
raise it by hand to dispatch the canary. `opnsense-testbed-up.timer` and
`opnsense-testbed-canary.timer` remain installed but **deliberately disabled** - do not re-enable
them; GitHub delayed their scheduled runs by two to three and a half hours every day, which is why
the schedule was abandoned rather than retimed.

`opnsense-testbed-down.timer` is a **five-minute watchdog**, not the old 08:30 daily backstop. It
fires every five minutes and powers the lab off whenever no hold is live, which bounds an abandoned
lab - a cancelled run, a lost runner - to five minutes instead of until the next morning.

Consequences for a wave:

- **Raising the lab is a main-thread action.** A lane never powers the testbed; it reports that it
  needs live evidence and stops.
- **At most one consumer may use the testbed at a time.** There IS locking now - every lifecycle
  verb takes a `flock` - but it protects the POWER operations, not your API writes: two runs will
  still interleave writes against the same firewall and produce results neither can trust. The
  canary matrix is `max-parallel: 1` for this reason. A `down` that exits **8** stepped aside for a
  busy lock and stopped NOTHING; it is a retry, never a success.
- **The box is down unless someone raised it.** A pre-flight probe failure on a run nobody raised the
  lab for is not drift, not a box fault and not a regression. Do not open a task for it.

**Raising the lab by hand** is still authorised for interactive work, but the canary no longer needs
it. `oli` is reachable over the tailnet as `root` and carries the power scheduler:

```bash
ssh oli '/usr/local/bin/opnsense-testbed-power.sh status'      # hold state + every guest
ssh oli '/usr/local/bin/opnsense-testbed-power.sh up 7200'     # start in dependency order, 2h hold
ssh oli '/usr/local/bin/opnsense-testbed-power.sh release'     # clear the hold
ssh oli '/usr/local/bin/opnsense-testbed-power.sh down'        # refuses while a hold is live
```

Always pass `up` a hold sized to the work: without a live hold the five-minute watchdog powers the
lab off mid-run, and five minutes is not long. `up` blocks until **both** firewalls serve `:443`,
then proves the shared traffgen can actually reach BOTH of them before returning, so its return is
the readiness signal; never poll for it yourself. The session that raised the lab owns `release` then
`down` when it is finished; a forgotten hold lapses on its own and the watchdog takes the lab down.

**Never call `qm` or `pct` on `oli` directly.** The scheduler's hardcoded allowlist (102, 106, 105)
is the only thing standing between a typo and powering off home automation (100), the CI runners
(101), unifi-os (103), winsrv (104) or postgres (107). Drive power through the script, always, and
never derive an id from `qm list`. This is not hypothetical: a deny-path probe run with a genuinely
destructive command stopped home assistant for real. **A deny-path test uses a target that is
harmless when it succeeds** - `qm stop 999999`, never the worst thing the boundary exists to prevent.

**The testbed firewalls' API credentials are not on any laptop** — they live only in the repository's
`tailnet` GitHub environment (`DEVBOX_API_KEY`/`DEVBOX2_API_KEY`, and the DEVBOX2 pair for the release
box). So local `just capture` and `just run` cannot reach the testbed, and the only route to live
evidence is to raise the lab and dispatch the canary, which holds those secrets:

```bash
gh workflow run live-canary.yml --ref main
gh run list --workflow live-canary.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId,status,conclusion
```

That gives a **structure verdict, not a payload** — `cmd/apidrift` writes its captures to the
runner's temp and nothing uploads them. The consequence is a two-pass loop for any new endpoint:
land the struct derived from upstream source, push, dispatch the canary, and read its verdict against
the golden schema. A lane that needs to *see* a real payload cannot get one this way, and should say
so rather than inventing one.

**There is no production-firewall canary any more.** OPN-0106 retired it on 2026-09-20: the camden
timer, its service and the `prod` probe profile are all gone, and Rob's production firewall is no
longer probed by anything in this repo. It had reported byte-identical output on all 27 runs and ran
the same OPNsense build as the release lab box. A lane that finds a reference to it in an older task,
an exemption note or the CHANGELOG is reading history.

**Grafana Cloud is live.** `just grafana-check` regenerates and diffs local artifacts and touches
nothing remote. Pushing dashboards or rules to a stack is a main-thread action, not a lane's.

**Loki cannot show you a historical record for up to two hours.** The querier does not send a query
to ingesters beyond `query_ingesters_within` (3h), so a log entry stamped older than that reads only
from the store, and it reaches the store when its ingester chunk flushes. A `configchange` diff
replayed from a seeded cursor carries the retained revision's timestamp, hours or days old; three
proof runs shipped one each, queried within a minute, and saw nothing, while the records were sitting
unflushed. **A proof that asserts its own historical record within the run can never pass.** Assert on
the previous instance's records instead, or report visibility-pending rather than absent, and read
`logs_shipped_total`, `logs_dropped_total{reason}` and `partialSuccess` off the exporter for the
drop-or-not question. Entries older than the tenant's `reject_old_samples_max_age` are rejected
outright and now surface as `logs_dropped_total{reason="rejected"}`.

**Guest access is through the power script's `exec` and `put` subcommands** (since wave 9), never
`qm` or `pct` directly. `put` is container-only because `qm` has no guest file-write; a VM fetches a
release archive itself with `exec <id> -- fetch -o <tmp> <release-url>` and verifies the sha256
in-guest against `checksums.txt`. Both testbed firewalls run the QEMU guest agent, and 105 carries
`python3` and `curl` (112 did too, and is gone). The exporter starts on a guest with no real credential: `--opnsense.api-key`
is a presence check only, and with `--exporter.instance-label` set startup makes no API call, so
`--opnsense.address 127.0.0.1:1` plus a dummy key and secret gives a receiver whose collectors merely
fail. **The throughput pair is now firewall-to-container, not container-to-container.** The two-host
UDP pair 105-to-112 died with 112, so bind receivers on 102 `vtnet2` against 105 `eth0` - both sit on
the untagged TESTLAN that BOTH firewalls share, which is what lets one container serve both profiles.
The WAN side is behind pf and would measure the firewall, not the receiver.

**105's interfaces, and why each exists.** `eth0` TESTLAN (untagged `vmbr9`, shared with both
firewalls, carries the default route and a DHCPv6 lease); `eth1` VLAN 90; `eth2` CPORTAL (no lease
expected, captive portal); `eth3` the RELEASE firewall's client segment (`vmbr9` tag 40), which
exists solely so Kea on 106 has a lease to report. `eth3` requests neither routers nor DNS, so it
cannot take over the container's routing - do not "fix" that by removing the restriction.

**v4.2.0 cannot start with the syslog receiver on a stock FreeBSD `kern.ipc.maxsockbuf`.** The
kernel refuses a 4 MiB `SO_RCVBUF` with ENOBUFS instead of clamping (OPN-0101, fixed at a86cbb65).
Any FreeBSD trial of the receiver needs a binary at or after that fix.

## Ownership — the append-only registries

Adding a collector or an endpoint touches a fixed set of shared files that every lane wants to append
to. **One owner per file, or a single wiring pass at the end.** The registries, in the order the
collector checklist in `AGENTS.md` hits them:

| File | What every lane wants to append |
|---|---|
| `internal/collector/collector.go` | subsystem const, `Without*Collector()`, `SubsystemDisplayNames` |
| `internal/collector/interval_tiers.go` | `collectorTiers` entry |
| `internal/options/collectors.go` | flag, `CollectorsDisableSwitch` field, switch entry, `CollectorFlags` |
| `main.go` | the `if !collectorsSwitches.X` wiring |
| `opnsense/client.go` | `defaultEndpoints()` |
| `opnsense/contract.go` | `postEndpoints` |
| `opnsense/cache.go` | `NegativeCacheable404Endpoints()` / `PluginGatedEndpoints()` |
| `opnsense/schema_registry.go` | `schemaRegistry` |
| `opnsense/testdata/schemas/exemptions.json` | `missingOK` / `knownExtraTopKeys` |
| `grafana/build_dashboard.py` | `register_subsystem_tabs` |

Counts pinned in tests move with these (`TestNewClient_EndpointCount`, the golden POST count, the
docs count pins, the rule-count pins). A lane that appends without bumping its count leaves the build
red for everyone.

**Escape hatch.** A lane that needs a change outside its boundary states the exact edit and stops —
it does not make it, and it does not silently work around it. A boundary with no escape hatch is a
stop condition wearing a safety label.

## Recurring defects in this codebase

Five classes, each with instances. These are what a review pass should actually look for.

### 1. Modelling a payload shape upstream cannot produce

The single most expensive class here. A struct is written against one observed response and the
branch it invents is never taken.

- `metadata.subsystems` was modelled as "the 26.1.11 shape"; upstream never populated it on any
  release. Cost two fabricated fixtures and a permanently dead branch (#284).
- unbound query-class counters decoded as a fixed `IN` field, when it is a map.
- nginx `overCounts` modelled as one union struct, when it is per zone kind — and as a number, when
  it is an object.
- smartctl wear percentages decoded as numbers, when they are objects.
- `endurance_used` given a `threshold_percent` it does not have.

**The rule that prevents it:** verify against the OPNsense controller/script that *builds* the
payload, and check whether the key is conditional, before writing the struct. The canary triage
verdicts in `AGENTS.md` are the decision procedure; the trap is reaching for `drop`/`chase` before
asking whether upstream changed at all. `box-state` was the right answer 7/7 in #271 and 7/7 in #243.

### 2. Flow correlation: orientation, pairing and double-counting

`internal/flow/` has produced more corrections than any other package. Every one is a case where two
records that describe the same connection were treated as independent, or one record's direction was
inferred from something that is not evidence.

- orientation decided by arrival order rather than by evidence;
- merge endpoints paired by position rather than by address;
- NAT'd conversations counted twice, then paired by conversation only when the exact window cannot
  close;
- a merged record's two halves not split into Tx and Rx;
- a window partial compared against a whole connection without stating the byte basis;
- repair markers not unioned across a conversation's fragments.

**Assume any new flow logic double-counts or mis-orients until a test says otherwise.** This is the
one area where test-first is not negotiable regardless of change size.

### 3. Alert rules that fire on a single sample

Rules authored against one observed spike, with no sustain and no hysteresis.

- `OPNsenseDHCP6AllocationFailures` fired on a single event;
- `OPNsenseNetmapRingFull` meant one burst, not a sustained condition;
- the gateway flapping rule had no hysteresis;
- `OPNsenseFlowSourceDivergence` was deleted outright — its threshold sat **below the metric's
  floor**, so it could never mean anything.

**Before adding a rule, state what the metric's floor and normal range actually are.** A threshold
that cannot be crossed, or that any single sample crosses, is worse than no rule.

### 4. Decoded and dropped

A per-row payload is unmarshalled and its identifying dimension quietly discarded (#544). This has a
mechanical detector: `just fieldaudit` reports struct fields in package `opnsense` that are
unmarshalled and never read, and the same analysis runs as a unit test, so `just test` already gates
it. If you add an exemption, write the reason.

### 5. Public metadata leaking into a public repo

This repository is public and `backlog/` is now committed with it.

- `just check-public-ips` rejects any globally routable IP literal in source, tests, fixtures or docs
  without a justified entry in `scripts/public-ip-allowlist.json` (#565). RFC1918, loopback,
  link-local, CGNAT, multicast and the RFC 5737 / RFC 3849 documentation ranges are never flagged.
- Golden schemas are **structure-only** — key paths and JSON types, never response values.
- Credentials have twice reached places they should not: request headers into a capture, and a bearer
  token surviving a redirect. Redact at the boundary, not at the sink.

**This now extends to the tracker, and `just check-public-ips` scans `backlog/` like any other
committed content** — verified 2026-08-14 by writing a task that quoted the offending literals from
OPN-0002 and watching the gate flag 18 new violations in the task file. **A task about a leaked
address must describe it, never quote it**: give `file:line` and say what kind of address it is, and
let the reader open the line. The same holds for docs.

Tasks and docs must not carry real account identifiers, hostnames beyond the ones already public in
this repo, device names, addresses, or data-archive cell values. Write the shape, not the instance.
Sweep before committing:

```bash
grep -rniE "rob-knight\.net|@gmail|@rob-knight|github_pat_|[0-9]{1,3}(\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}" backlog/ \
  && echo "REVIEW THESE"
```

Tailnet host names (`camden`, `oli`) are already all over this repo's scripts and issue history, so
they are not the thing to hunt for. Tokens, IPs and account identifiers are.

## Lane conventions

- **Never two lanes on one task.** The v1.50.x fix covers the `task edit` funnel but not reorder,
  draft saves, the TUI path, `doc update` or decision updates.
- **`--append-notes` and `--append-plan` only.** Bare `--notes` / `--plan` silently replace the whole
  section and destroy another session's writes with exit code 0. A `PreToolUse` hook on Rob's
  machines denies the bare form, so being blocked there is the guard working. It does not fire in
  CI or on a machine without that config, which is why the rule is written down as well.
- **Finalize in one call** so an interrupted lane cannot leave finished work looking unfinished:
  `backlog task edit OPN-0007 --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 -s Done`.
- **Commits come from the campaign root only.** Lanes do not commit. `auto_commit` is off.
- **The index is shared. A lane that stages files can put them into the root's next commit.** Wave 8
  committed a half-finished console because the console lane ran `git add` while the root was staging
  an unrelated batch and then committed bare. Lanes never stage; the root commits with an explicit
  pathspec (`git commit -- <paths>`), and reviews `git diff --cached --stat` against the list of files
  it meant to commit before every commit.
- **Generated artifacts are regenerated, never hand-edited** — anything between `docgen` markers,
  `grafana/dashboard*.json`, the grafana-managed manifests, `opnsense/testdata/schemas/`. A lane that
  hand-edits one produces a diff that `just docs-check` or `just grafana-check` reverts on the next
  regeneration, silently losing the work.
