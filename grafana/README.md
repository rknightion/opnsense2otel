# opnsense2otel - Grafana assets

This folder ships everything you need to visualise and alert on the metrics exposed by
opnsense2otel:

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `dashboard.json` | The **operational** dashboard: a **Grafana v2 dynamic dashboard** (`dashboard.grafana.app/v2`) organised into 7 top-level domains, rendering conditionally. UID `opnsense-exporter` (frozen pre-rename; see [Navigation](#navigation-dashboard-uids-links-and-drilldowns)). |
| `dashboard-health.json` | The **self-observability companion** (UID `opnsense-exporter-health`): an Overview of health tiles, then Collection (scrape/poll, OPNsense API), Delivery (metrics & OTLP, log shipping, flow pipeline), Runtime, and the bundled recording rules' output — the exporter watching itself. Cross-linked with the operational dashboard, carrying the selected instance and time range. |
| `build_dashboard.py` | Generator for BOTH dashboards. Run `python3 build_dashboard.py`. |
| `builder.py`, `tabs/` | The builder framework and one module per tab. See `tabs/AUTHORING.md`. |
| `alerts/grafana-managed/` | Alert + recording rules as **Grafana-managed** `rules.alerting.grafana.app/v0alpha1` manifests (+ two folders), pushable with `gcx`. |
| `alerts/build_rules.py` | Generator for the Grafana-managed rule manifests from a single source. |
| `tests/test_empty_state_contract.py` | Gate: a panel that zero-fills with `or vector(0)` must be gated by a sentinel fed by its OWN collector, or the green `0` reads as "checked, nothing found" when the truth is "never checked". Collector ownership is derived from the generated metric docs and `sentinel-contract.json`, never hand-listed. |
| `alerts/ruleeval.py` | A model of Grafana's alert-rule state machine (pending period, `noDataState`, `execErrState`, MissingSeries eviction), run against the generated manifests by `tests/test_rule_behaviour.py`. Not a PromQL evaluator — see its module docstring. |
| `runbooks.md` | **Generated** - full per-alert runbook: what each rule measures, its threshold/window, absent/no-data semantics, first checks, likely causes, and recovery verification. Regenerate with `just rules`. |

The dashboard is **mixed-datasource**: Prometheus metrics plus opt-in **Loki** log panels
(raw Zenarmor/syslog streams, top-talker tables) that auto-hide when no matching log stream
exists. It works fully on a Prometheus datasource alone; the Loki panels light up when a Loki
datasource carrying the exporter's shipped logs is selected.

## Requirements

- **Grafana 13+** (Grafana Cloud or self-hosted). The v2 schema with `TabsLayout` and
  `conditionalRendering` is required for the show/hide behaviour. **No schema-v1 / Grafana 11-12
  build is shipped** — that behaviour is the point of the dashboard and classic schema cannot
  express it, so a converted copy would show every plugin-gated tab permanently empty. Grafana
  11.5 rejects the v2 file (`400 Dashboard title cannot be empty`, which points at the wrong
  thing) and **Grafana 12.4 accepts it with 200 and renders nothing** — verified against pinned
  containers, and worth knowing because neither says so usefully.
- A Prometheus-compatible datasource scraping the exporter.
- For the health dashboard's **Exporter Runtime** tab (*Build & Collectors*) you need an exporter
  build that emits `opnsense_exporter_build_info` and `opnsense_exporter_collector_enabled` (added in
  this fork). Older builds simply leave those two panels empty.

### Optional panel plugins

The dashboards use built-in Grafana panels for all essential views. Two catalogue plugins add
specialised Flow Volume views:

- `netsage-sankey-panel` renders bounded source-scope to destination-scope traffic paths.
- `marcusolsson-treemap-panel` renders the byte-weighted application hierarchy.

Install those exact plugin IDs from the Grafana plugin catalogue. If either is unavailable, Grafana
shows its standard missing-plugin message only in that additive panel; the same conditional row keeps
the built-in raw-log or exact-value table that exposes the underlying data. The builder also supports
`grafana-polystat-panel` for dense status sets, but the generated dashboards do not currently depend
on it because no adopted status view improved on the existing mapped status-history panels.

## The dashboard

Two dashboards, 57 tabs grouped by feature (generated list, do not hand-edit). The operational dashboard runs from the first `Overview` to `Siproxd`; the health companion starts at the SECOND `Overview` and runs to `Recording rules`:

<!-- docgen:begin:dashboard-tabs -->
Overview, Config, System & Resources, Memory & Storage, Firmware & Backup, Hardware & SMART, Kernel Memory, Services, Cron & DynDNS, Certificates, UPS, Monit, HA Sync, CARP / HA, Interfaces, Gateways & WAN, DNS - Unbound, DNS - Unbound Lists, DHCP, DHCP - ISC & Client, Routing & Neighbors, Protocol Stats, Protocol Stats - IP, NTP, Chrony, Traffic Shaper, NetFlow, Flow Volume, FRR Routing, FRR - OSPF, Captive Portal, Firewall & PF, Firewall Rules & NAT, Authentication & Audit, Aliases, IDS/IPS, CrowdSec, ClamAV, Q-Feeds, Zenarmor, VPN, VPN - IPsec, Tailscale, NetBird, Tor, Syslog, HAProxy, Relayd, Nginx, Siproxd, Overview, Scrape & Poll, OPNsense API, Metrics & OTLP, Log Shipping, Flow Pipeline, Exporter Runtime, Recording rules
<!-- docgen:end:dashboard-tabs -->

covering **every** metric the exporter emits (a coverage gate in `build_dashboard.py` fails the
build if any catalogue metric is left unreferenced).

The catalogue behind that gate has two halves, and until #428 it had only one. `docs/metrics/metrics.md`
is generated by walking the **collector** registry, so it covers firewall data and
`internal/collector`'s own meta metrics. Everything the exporter emits about itself from anywhere else
— the whole `opnsense_exporter_logs_*` family, the annotation writer, the OTLP delivery series — was
invisible to it and could ship with no panel and no complaint. `docs/metrics/self-metrics.md` is
generated by scanning the source for metric declarations (`scripts/docgen/selfmetrics.go`) rather than
by gathering a registry, so a metric is inventoried the moment it is *declared*, whether or not the
composition root happens to wire it up. Both files feed `load_catalogue()`.

The one deliberate exclusion is `go_*` and `process_*`: they come from the Prometheus client library's
own collectors rather than from this codebase, and they are charted from the Exporter Runtime row
behind the `has_go_runtime` sentinel.

### Dynamic show/hide

Feature tabs and rows for optional collectors / OPNsense plugins **hide automatically when their
metrics are absent**, so the same dashboard adapts to any deployment. This is driven by hidden
sentinel template variables (`label_values(metric{opnsense_instance=~"$opnsense_instance"},
__name__)` → empty when the metric is absent) plus `conditionalRendering` on the tab/row.

Sentinels are scoped to the **selected** appliance, not the fleet. On a multi-box Prometheus an
unscoped sentinel would light a tab up because a *different* firewall runs the plugin, leaving
every panel behind it reading "No data" — a navigation element that lies. Metrics with no
appliance label (`go_*`, `process_*`) are scoped by joining to `opnsense_up` on the co-scrape
identity `(job, instance)`. Loki panels are scoped the same way via `service_instance_id`, which
carries the same value space as `opnsense_instance`.

Presence means **the series exists**, not that its value is above zero: a box running Kea but not
legacy ISC DHCPv4 shows only the Kea section, and it keeps showing it while the pool is idle
(gating on lease COUNT used to hide a live-but-empty backend along with the health stat that
answered "is it up?").

Examples of what hides when unused: NetFlow, VPN, UPS, HAProxy, CrowdSec, Zenarmor and recording-rule
tabs; OpenVPN / WireGuard-peer / IPsec-tunnel rows; CARP VIPs, SMART, ACME, DynDNS, and Go-runtime rows.

### Event annotations

The dashboard ships a generated event timeline (`annotations.py`, #421) so a discontinuity on any
panel can be attributed without leaving the tab. **16 layers**, each individually toggleable; most
are on by default and the rest are one click away.

Three mechanisms, chosen per source:

- **Prometheus, value-as-time.** For a metric whose value *is* an instant, Grafana's
  `useValueForTime` places the marker at the value rather than at the sample that carried it. The
  expression is always `<expr> * 1000 > $__from < $__to`: milliseconds because that is how Grafana
  reads the value, and the window bound because otherwise a months-old event renders on every
  six-hour view.
- **Loki, the record's own timestamp.** Used where the event was logged and the log carries detail
  no metric can — which API endpoint a config change hit, which gateway alarmed, why CARP demoted.
- **Grafana's own annotation store**, for events the exporter *wrote* there with
  `--annotations.enabled` (see `internal/annotations`, and *Writing annotations* below). Same events
  as the metric layers derive, but written once — so they also show on every other dashboard, in
  Explore, and anywhere else that queries the tag.

`opnsense_system_boot_timestamp_seconds` exists for this: `time() - opnsense_system_uptime_seconds`
is recomputed on every evaluation, and a live one-hour query produced two inferred epochs a second
apart, so a derived reboot marker would move between refreshes.

`step` is deliberately left at Grafana's default. A coarse fixed step is the obvious way to stop one
long-lived gauge value producing a marker per sample, but it drops events: the live box emitted two
`config_change` records inside the same second. Duplicate markers at one instant collapse visually;
a missing config change is a wrong answer to the question the layer exists to answer.

**Default on:** everything except the one layer below — Reboot, Config change, Interface counter
reset, Boot environment created (upgrade), Certificate renewed, GeoIP database updated, nginx config
reloaded, Public IP updated, IDS ruleset updated, Config change detail, Gateway alarm, CARP
transition, Tunnel lifecycle, Exporter-pushed events, and External change events (#523).
**Default off:** Threat feed updated — Q-Feeds refreshes on a far tighter schedule than an IDS
ruleset, so its markers are the ones that would bury the rest of the timeline.

No annotation tags an address, a hostname or a raw log body — tags are indexed and queryable across
dashboards, which is a far wider exposure than annotation text an operator has to hover to read. The
audit layer tags only `config_uri`, never the `user@address` its body carries.

Annotations have no `conditionalRendering`, and need none: a disabled collector or an unshipped log
source produces no series, and no series produces no annotation.

**`External change events` is a deployment-local overlay, not an exporter feature.** It reads
annotations written into Grafana's store by automation outside this repository, under the tags in
`EXTERNAL_CHANGE_TAGS`. It is generated so that publishing generated output cannot delete a layer the
live dashboard has carried since before the generator existed. Both tags are load-bearing: without
the dashboard-scoping tag, every change event in the estate lands on this dashboard. Change the
constant if your deployment tags them differently, or drop the layer if you have no such automation.

### Writing annotations from the exporter

`--annotations.enabled` makes the exporter push these events into Grafana itself, rather than leaving
every dashboard to re-derive them:

```bash
--annotations.enabled \
--annotations.grafana-url=https://mystack.grafana.net \
--annotations.token=<service-account token with annotation write>   # or …_TOKEN_FILE
```

How it works, and why it is built this way:

- **Detection is a diff over the metrics, not a second poll.** The watcher gathers the same registry
  the OTLP bridge gathers, so it issues no OPNsense API call of its own and cannot add load.
- **Each annotation carries the event's own instant**, so a cold-tier collector noticing fifteen
  minutes late still places the marker correctly. The interface marker is a system-uptime reading, so
  it is anchored to the boot epoch; with no boot epoch it is skipped rather than dated from zero.
- **Restarts do not duplicate.** On start the writer reads back its own annotations over
  `--annotations.lookback` and seeds from them. If that read fails, the first pass seeds *silently*:
  duplicating the whole recent timeline is worse than missing one event.
- **Old events are not news.** An instant older than the lookback is history — otherwise every fresh
  deployment would annotate a reboot from months ago. An instant more than five minutes in the future
  is refused.
- **A failed write is retried**, because it is only marked as seen once Grafana has accepted it, and
  `--annotations.max-per-cycle` caps one bad reading at a bounded number of writes.
- **The push set follows the dashboard's own defaults.** A watch marked `DefaultOff` in
  `internal/annotations/catalog.go` is not written, and `tests/test_annotations.py` fails if that
  flag and the layer's `enable` disagree. This is not cosmetic: **`Exporter-pushed events` is a
  catch-all** on the single `opnsense2otel` tag, so a pushed kind renders on this dashboard no
  matter what its per-kind toggle says — the toggle only governs the derived layer (#540). Override
  the set with `--annotations.kinds`, which is exact once given.
- **Tags are closed vocabularies**: `opnsense2otel`, the event kind, `instance:<name>`, and any
  identifier named in the catalogue (`interface:LAN`, `ruleset:…`). Never an address, an identity or
  free text. `--annotations.extra-tags` adds your own.
- Delivery is observable — `opnsense_exporter_annotations_written_total`, `_failed_total`,
  `_skipped_total` and `_last_success_timestamp_seconds`. A successful start proves nothing, because
  nothing is written until an event happens.

The token needs the annotation write permission and nothing else. This is the exporter's only
outbound write, which is why it is off by default and why there is no TLS-verification escape hatch:
trust a private CA through `SSL_CERT_FILE` instead.

Every instant-valued metric in the catalogue is either a layer or carries a written reason in
`annotations.NOT_ANNOTATED`, and `tests/test_annotations.py` fails on one that is neither — so a new
`*_timestamp_seconds` metric is a decision rather than an oversight. Heartbeats
(`*_last_poll_*`, per-peer handshakes), future-dated values (`*_next_update_*`, license expiry) and
upstream-authored timestamps (ClamAV's signature *build* date) are the recurring exclusion reasons.

### Variables

- **Data source** - pick your Prometheus datasource.
- **Loki data source** - pick the Loki datasource carrying the exporter's shipped logs
  (default `grafanacloud-logs`). The Loki panels/rows (Zenarmor, syslog streams) hide when it
  has no matching stream, so a metrics-only deployment is unaffected.
- **OPNsense instance** - multi-select over `opnsense_instance` (supports multiple exporters).
- **Interface** - multi-select, scopes the Interfaces tab.
- **Device (pf/netflow/interfaces)** - multi-select over kernel interface names (`igb0`, `pppoe0`),
  the label space PF, NetFlow and vnStat panels filter on. Built from the union of every
  device-bearing collector, so disabling any one of them (firewall, NetFlow, vnStat, interfaces,
  flow) leaves the picker populated.

### Navigation: dashboard UIDs, links and drilldowns

Every link is generated from `uids.py`, which is the single source of truth for dashboard
UIDs (#419). A UID is never typed at a call site, and `tests/test_links.py` fails the build on
any link that breaks the contract below.

**The UIDs deliberately still spell the pre-rename project name** (`opnsense-exporter` /
`opnsense-exporter-health`), even though the dashboard **titles** are `opnsense2otel` /
`opnsense2otel Health`. A UID is the key in every bookmark and every alert's
`__dashboardUid__` annotation; renaming it is a delete-and-recreate that 404s all of those at
once. Do not "tidy" it to match the new project name — see the note on `MAIN_UID` in
`uids.py`.

**Destinations.** `opnsense-exporter` is this dashboard. `opnsense-exporter-health` is
**reserved** for the self-observability dashboard (#431): the UID is frozen so work can be built
against it, but it carries `exists=False`, so `dash_url()` refuses it and **no link to it is
emitted until the dashboard exists**. A link to a UID that 404s is worse than no link, which is
why the flag exists rather than a plain list. Three retired companion UIDs (`rovp4pp`,
`opnsense-network-activity`, `ddfj9vprnpio74a`) are recorded as never-reuse; a test asserts they
appear nowhere in the generated manifest. The Zenarmor companion is deliberately not a
destination — Zenarmor is a sentinel-gated tab in this dashboard (#435), and an in-dashboard tab
needs no link.

**Context that travels.** Each internal link is a relative `/d/<uid>?…` URL carrying
`${__url_time_range}`, `${opnsense_instance:queryparam}` and `${datasource:queryparam}` (plus
`${loki_datasource:queryparam}` for log-facing destinations). Grafana's `keepTime`/`includeVars`
booleans are deliberately unused: `includeVars` would propagate all ~100 hidden presence
sentinels, and a panel-level data link has no such booleans at all.

**What a drilldown does.**

- *Field links* (click a series) re-scope the dashboard to that series: `$interface` on the
  interface, flow and firewall-log panels, `$device` on the pf/device-space panels. The two
  label spaces are disjoint (#98), so the helper — `focus_interface()` or `focus_device()` — is
  chosen per metric family, and a test rejects a link templating a label its own panel never
  returns.
- *Panel links* (panel header) jump to the tab that answers the next question, keeping the
  instance and window: interfaces → firewall/flow, firewall → log-derived events, gateway/CARP →
  syslog stream, log shipping → diagnostics.

**Tab targeting degrades, never breaks.** A tab link adds `dtab=<domain>` and
`<domain>-dtab=<leaf>`, Grafana's own tab URL-sync keys. A Grafana build that does not honour
them opens the dashboard on its default tab with the time range and instance still correct, and
a tab hidden by its presence sentinel behaves the same way. Slugs are derived from the tab titles
of the build itself, so renaming a tab fails the build rather than silently mis-targeting.

### Deploy the dashboard

Both dashboards deploy the same way, and both should be deployed: the operational dashboard's
"Exporter Health" summary row links to the companion, and that link 404s if only one is imported.

**Grafana UI:** Dashboards → New → Import, and upload `dashboard.json`, then `dashboard-health.json`
(Grafana 13+).

**gcx (standalone / unmanaged dashboard only):**
```bash
gcx dashboards create -f dashboard.json          # first time
gcx dashboards update opnsense-exporter -f dashboard.json   # subsequent updates
# or, for a folder of resources, with the UI staying editable:
gcx resources push -p dashboard.json --omit-manager-fields
```

Do not run those update/push commands against a GitSync-managed production UID. Test a generated
scratch UID first, then publish the canonical manifest only through the synced repository:

```bash
DASH_NAME=opnsense2otel-review python3 build_dashboard.py
gcx dashboards create -f dashboard.json
gcx dashboards snapshot opnsense2otel-review --since 6h --width 1920

# Restore the canonical UID, then copy/commit this file in the GitSync repository.
python3 build_dashboard.py
cp dashboard.json /path/to/gitsync-repo/networking/opnsense-exporter.json
cp dashboard-health.json /path/to/gitsync-repo/networking/opnsense-exporter-health.json
```

**GitOps (GitSync):** commit and push the manifest at the target repository path; GitSync performs
the production update and retains manager ownership. The canonical `metadata.name`
(`opnsense-exporter`) is the dashboard UID/slug. Delete the scratch UID after the synced production
dashboard has rendered successfully.

### Regenerate

```bash
cd grafana
python3 build_dashboard.py          # writes both dashboards + prints coverage (NNN/NNN)
python3 build_dashboard.py --check  # coverage gate only (non-zero exit if any metric unreferenced)
```
Set `DASH_NAME=<slug>` to override the OPERATIONAL dashboard's `metadata.name` (used for
scratch/validation copies). The companion's UID is fixed, because cross-dashboard links resolve
through the frozen registry in `uids.py`.

The coverage gate spans the **family**: a metric charted on either dashboard counts as covered,
which is what lets the self-observability panels live on their own file without every self-metric
reading as missing.

## Alerts & recording rules

`alerts/` contains **64 alert rules** and **14 recording rules**, shipped as **Grafana-managed
alerting** manifests. Grafana-managed is the only supported format - it carries `noDataState`
(so the exporter-down / NoData case actually fires) and Grafana templating, neither of which a
portable Prometheus rule-group file can express. Alerts carry a `severity` label and runbook
annotation; recording rules follow the `instance:opnsense_<subsystem>_<measurement>:<op>`
convention.

### Grafana-managed format

`alerts/grafana-managed/` holds one `rules.alerting.grafana.app/v0alpha1` manifest per rule
plus two folder manifests. Rules are sorted into **two Grafana folders**: firewall-operational
ones in `opnsense2otel-alerts` (`_folder.json`) and exporter self-health ones in
`opnsense2otel-health-alerts` (`_folder-health.json`). The split is for the 3am read — an
`OPNsenseFirewallUnhealthy` page means go look at the firewall, an `OPNsenseLogShipSinkErrors`
page means the firewall is probably fine and the monitoring is not. Membership is declared per
rule and cross-checked: a rule built purely from `opnsense_exporter_*` metrics that is not
declared self-health fails the tests. Push with gcx:
```bash
cd grafana/alerts
python3 build_rules.py --datasource <your-prom-uid>   # default: grafanacloud-prom
gcx resources push -p grafana-managed/_folder.json         # create the folders first
gcx resources push -p grafana-managed/_folder-health.json
gcx resources push -p grafana-managed/                    # then the rules
```

Regenerate with `--stack` to attach an IRM label contract (`domain=infra`, plus `page=true` on
critical rules) for routing through a notification policy / on-call. Use `--folder <uid>` and
`--health-folder <uid>` to target specific Grafana folders.

Regenerate under the same `--stack` setting you deploy with. `build_rules.py` without `--stack`
emits no routing labels at all, so pushing that output over rules created with `--stack` strips
their IRM routing labels.

### Alerts

**Two rules cover an exporter going away, and they are not interchangeable.** Grafana
treats a query that returns *nothing* differently from a query that still returns series
with one dimension missing:

- **No Data** — the rule's query returns no series at all. `noDataState` governs it, so
  `OPNsenseExporterDown` (`noDataState: Alerting`) pages when the whole fleet is gone.
- **MissingSeries** — the query still returns series, but one has disappeared from the
  result. Grafana retains that alert instance briefly and then **evicts it as stale**. It
  never passes through `noDataState`.

So on a multi-exporter setup, losing one box entirely is MissingSeries, not No Data, and
`OPNsenseExporterDown` alone would silently lose that alert instance while the surviving
exporters kept it Normal. `OPNsenseExporterInstanceMissing` closes that: it compares the
last hour's `present_over_time` baseline against what is reporting now, so an instance
that stops reporting is named rather than evicted.

The baseline is historical rather than a configured inventory — nothing to maintain, and a
new exporter protects itself once it has been up an hour. The cost is that a **deliberately
decommissioned instance keeps alerting until it has been absent for 1h**; silence it until
then, or wait it out.

`alerts/` contains **64 alert rules** covering exporter/instance liveness, collector health,
gateways, system resources, certificates, services, log shipping, OTLP delivery, VPN/HA/CARP, IDS,
and flow capture. The full list - trigger condition, threshold and window, absent/no-data
semantics, first checks, likely causes, and recovery verification for every single one - is
generated from the exact same `RULES` source as the manifests into
[`grafana/runbooks.md`](runbooks.md); `grafana/tests/test_runbooks.py` fails CI on a missing,
duplicate, or stale entry, so this README deliberately does not carry a second, hand-maintained
copy of that table. Thresholds are conservative defaults - tune them in `build_rules.py` for your
environment. Every alert's own `runbook_url` annotation links straight to its section.

**Every alert also links to the panel that explains it.** A notification says what crossed a
threshold; the paired `__dashboardUid__` / `__panelId__` annotations say where to look, so
Grafana's "View panel" opens the canonical graph rather than a dashboard you then have to search.
Operational alerts point into `dashboard.json` and exporter-health alerts into
`dashboard-health.json` - the same split as the two Grafana folders - except for the flow-pipeline
rules, whose panels legitimately live on the health dashboard because the correlator and the GeoIP
databases are exporter-side machinery.

The mapping is the `PANEL_LINKS` table in `build_rules.py`, keyed by alert title and resolved
against the **generated** dashboards by panel **title**, never by a literal id: ids come from a
counter in the dashboard builder and renumber whenever a panel is inserted. A retitled panel
therefore fails the build instead of deep-linking into whatever panel inherited the number. A title
used twice - an Overview summary tile plus the domain-tab panel - must name its tab
(`("Gateway Status", "Gateways & WAN")`); an unqualified duplicate is an error, because linking the
first match sends whoever is on call to the wrong tab. `grafana/tests/test_panel_links.py` gates all
of it, including that every alert appears in `PANEL_LINKS` or in `PANEL_LINK_EXEMPT` with a reason,
so a new alert cannot quietly ship unlinked.

**Stale-data alerting is tier-aware, and attempt age is not freshness.** Each collector polls on
its own tier (fast 15s / medium 60s / slow 5m / cold 15m, overridable with
`--collector.poll-interval-override`), and a failed poll that produced nothing deliberately
retains the last-good values rather than blanking the dashboard. Two consequences the rules above
encode:

- `opnsense_exporter_collector_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` advances on **every attempt**,
  successful or not, so it measures scheduler liveness and never data age. The dashboard panel is
  titled *Collector Last Attempt Age* for that reason. True data age is
  `opnsense_exporter_collector_snapshot_timestamp_seconds` (buffer last replaced) and
  `opnsense_exporter_collector_last_success_timestamp_seconds` (last fully clean poll).
- `OPNsenseCollectorDataStale` / `OPNsenseCollectorDegraded` express tolerance in **missed poll
  intervals**, dividing the age by `opnsense_exporter_collector_poll_interval_seconds` (plus a
  120s scrape-lag allowance), so one rule covers every tier: a persistent failure fires ~8m into
  the fast tier and ~52m into the cold tier, while a single failed poll followed by recovery peaks
  at ~2 missed intervals on all four tiers and cannot fire. `OPNsenseEndpointErrors` keeps its 2m
  window and stays the fast/medium-tier signal that names the failing *endpoint*; it cannot fire
  for a slow/cold-tier collector (the window is empty between two once-per-tier attempts), and
  widening it would reintroduce the fire-after-recovery bug those windows were tightened to fix.

**`OPNsenseOTLPDeliveryFailing` cannot page a pure-OTLP backend.** The exporter cannot ship its own
failure metric through the path that is failing, so `opnsense_exporter_otlp_*` is a signal for
`/metrics` scrapers, for the passive operator console, and for post-recovery forensics - not an
in-band outage page. On a pure-OTLP backend, the in-band symptom of this failure mode is staleness
of the exporter's data at the backend. `opnsense_exporter_otlp_enabled=1` means the push pipeline
is *running*, not that delivery *works*: the OTLP exporter connects lazily, so it reads 1 from
startup even against a wrong endpoint.

**Gateway coverage.** `opnsense_gateways_status` is emitted for every *enabled* gateway using the
API-reported status, including gateways with OPNsense monitoring disabled (a common PPPoE/DHCPv6-PD
default-gateway pattern) - so `OPNsenseGatewayDown` covers them too. The rule's `noDataState` stays
`OK` (a totally-absent series means the exporter itself is down, which `OPNsenseExporterDown`
already pages on); it does not fire for *disabled* gateways, which have no status series by design.

**`opnsense_up` is reachability-only.** It is 1 whenever the exporter reaches and parses the
OPNsense system-status API, and 0 only when that call fails (unreachable / auth / HTTP error).
A reachable box that self-reports a degraded subsystem - e.g. a leftover crash report puts
OPNsense's *own* overall status into ERROR - keeps `opnsense_up = 1`; that state surfaces via
`opnsense_system_status_code` (2 = OK, 1 = NOTICE, 0 = WARNING, -1 = ERROR) and the per-subsystem
`opnsense_firewall_status` / `opnsense_crash_reporter_status` gauges, which drive the
lower-severity warnings above. So `OPNsenseExporterDown` (critical/page) fires only on genuine
unreachability, not on a benign degraded-subsystem notice. **Operators upgrading from an exporter
build before this change:** `opnsense_up` no longer flips to 0 for a degraded-but-reachable box,
so a leftover crash report now pages as a warning (`OPNsenseCrashReports`) instead of a critical
(`OPNsenseExporterDown`).

### Recording rules

`alerts/` contains **14 recording rules** following the
`instance:opnsense_<subsystem>_<measurement>:<op>` naming convention - precomputed
aggregations/ratios (interface throughput, PF state utilization, DNS cache hit ratio, gateway
loss, HAProxy/Zenarmor block ratios, tunnel/peer down-counts, IDS alert volume, deduplicated flow
byte rate) that dashboards and alerts reuse rather than recomputing. The full list with each
rule's expression is generated alongside the alert runbooks in
[`grafana/runbooks.md`](runbooks.md#recording-rules).
