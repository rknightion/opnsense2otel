// way. The key is "opnsense.<Type>.<Field>" exactly as the tool reports it —
// fields of anonymous nested structs carry their full dotted path.
//
// The ledger is enforced in both directions: a dead field with no entry fails
// TestNoUnexemptedDeadFields, and an entry naming a field that no longer exists
// or is now read fails TestExemptionLedgerIsCurrent. Neither side can rot.
//
// Reasons that begin "SHOULD BE EXPORTED" are the honest ones: the data is worth
