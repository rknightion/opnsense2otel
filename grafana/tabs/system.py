"""
System & Resources tab for the opnsense2otel dashboard.

Covers:
  - System subsystem (12 metrics)
  - General health: opnsense_system_subsystem_status_code (per-subsystem health-check detail)
  - Activity subsystem (14 metrics) — thread-state counts, ZFS ARC composition (#551)
    and the aggregated `top` process table by user/command (#552)
  - CPU subsystem (6 metrics) — cumulative counters + SSE stream health (#559)
  - Mbuf subsystem (14 metrics)
  - Temperature subsystem (1 metric) — gated by has_temperature sentinel
  - SMART subsystem (18 metrics) — gated by has_smart sentinel; includes smartctl's own
    normalized SSD wear percentages (spare_available/endurance_used), the HDD/SSD rotation-rate
    discriminator, and a per-attribute failed-state gauge distinct from the drive-wide health (#577)
  - Firmware subsystem — including update-check health (#373), pending download
    size (#380), the pending major-release upgrade and the per-plugin size/update-policy
    gauges (#583)
  - Backup subsystem (3 metrics) — config backup freshness
  - Snapshots subsystem (3 metrics) — ZFS boot environment inventory
  - Auth subsystem — local user/group/API-key security posture plus password-age and
    login-shell aggregates (#583). Aggregate counts only: no usernames, ever.
