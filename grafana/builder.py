"""
Grafana v2 dynamic-dashboard builder framework for the opnsense2otel.

Emits a `dashboard.grafana.app/v2` manifest (TabsLayout + conditionalRendering).
Tab modules call the helper methods on a `Builder` instance; each helper registers
a panel in the shared `elements` map and returns its element name. Layout packing
is automatic (24-column grid, wrapping at column 24).

This file is the FROZEN API used by every tab module under `tabs/`. See
`grafana/README.md` (Authoring) for the contract. Conventions:

* Every panel query is filtered by the instance selector. Use `b.sel(metric, more)`
  to build `metric{opnsense_instance=~"$opnsense_instance"<more>}`.
* Every LogQL query is filtered by `loki_sel(matchers)`, which builds the stream
  selector `{service_instance_id=~"$opnsense_instance",<matchers>}` (#413).
* Datasources are referenced as `${datasource}` — never a hard-coded UID.
* conditionalRendering lives on TABS and ROWS only (never panels): pass `present=`
  a sentinel-variable name to `b.tab(...)` / `b.row(...)`.
* Sentinels are declared STRUCTURALLY (`b.sentinel(name, metric=..., scope=...)`),
  never as a raw query string, so a presence variable cannot be written fleet-wide
  by accident (#414).

        `mx` is MANDATORY on a percent/percentunit gauge (#649). Without a max the
        radial arc auto-scales to whatever the data happens to be, so a drive at 4%

        at meaningless positions on the dial — the exact opposite of what a gauge is

        unit's own domain, not a fabricated severity boundary, and omitting it is
        always a defect. Passing something other than 100 is fine and sometimes right

        """exprs = a one-element list holding the LogQL string, evaluated as an
        INSTANT query over `[$__range]` — the standard "topk over range" shape for
        high-cardinality log fields. `field_title` titles the ranked-label column
        ("Application", "DNS Query", ...).

        These panels carried `queryOptions.interval="5m"`, described here as a
        cardinality guard on wide time ranges. It was inert (#650): #471 converted
        them from range queries to instant ones, and an instant query has no step for
        a min interval to raise. The window has been `[$__range]` ever since — which
        `test_no_loki_table_uses_the_step_derived_auto_interval` is what pins — so the
        guard the comment described was already doing the work. Removed rather than
        left as config that reads as a live control.

        The transform chain, and why it is not the obvious one (#471):

        A LogQL metric query returns one frame per output series, and the series'
        labels sit on the value FIELD, not in the rows. `reduce{seriesToRows}` —
        what this helper used to do — therefore names each row after the frame's
        display name, which for such a frame is the serialised label set. Every
        table shipped `{app_name="STUN", service_instance_id="opnsense"}` as its
        key column: correct data, unreadable, and with the instance repeated
        inside every key rather than standing as a column of its own.

        So instead:

        1. `labelsToFields` (mode: columns) turns each frame's labels into real
           string fields and merges the frames into one table.
        2. `merge` is belt-and-braces: labelsToFields documents an internal merge,
           and this is a no-op on the single frame that leaves it. Without a merge
           a per-frame `groupBy` would emit 20 one-row frames.
        3. `organize` titles the three columns, fixes their order, and drops Time.

        There is deliberately NO aggregation step (#479). An earlier version ran
        `groupBy` here to re-sum the value, which a RANGE query needed because it
        returns many points per series. An instant query returns exactly one, so
        the aggregation is redundant — and it actively broke the table: `groupBy`
        looks its target field up by display name, and the Loki datasource stamps
        `displayNameFromDS` with the serialised label set, so it found no field
        called "Value" and silently dropped the value column. The table rendered
        with its key and instance columns and no number at all.

    # ---- grouping-level variable placement (#619) ------------------------
    #
    # `RowsLayoutRowSpec` and `TabsLayoutTabSpec` both accept their own
    # `variables: [...]`, and a variable declared on a tab only runs its query when
    # that tab is OPENED. This repo declares 98 hidden presence sentinels, every one
    # of which currently fires on cold load whether or not the operator ever visits
    # the tab it gates.
    #
    # Placement is DERIVED here rather than declared at the 127 call sites. The rule
    # that makes derivation worth it is the awkward one:
    #
    #   A TAB CANNOT GATE ITSELF ON A VARIABLE SCOPED TO ITSELF.
    #
    # The variable does not exist until the tab renders, so the gate evaluates
    # against nothing and the tab is hidden forever — on screen indistinguishable
    # from a tab correctly hidden for want of data. A variable that gates a tab
    # therefore belongs to that tab's PARENT, while a variable merely USED inside a
    # tab belongs to the tab. Getting that backwards is silent, and hand-writing it
    # 86 times is 86 chances to get it backwards. Computing it is one.
    #
    # Everything else falls out of one rule: a variable lives at the DEEPEST
    # grouping level that encloses every reference to it. Referenced from two
    # sibling leaves, or from anywhere outside the layout, and the deepest common
    # level is the dashboard, which is where it stays.

    # Reference positions are tuples of enclosing tab titles; () is the dashboard.
